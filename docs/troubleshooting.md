# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you resolve common issues with Mellow. If you can't find a solution here, visit our [support server](https://discord.gg/C3ZuXPP7Hc).

## ü§ñ Bot Commands & Responses

### Bot not responding to commands?

**Check Permissions:**

-   Ensure Mellow has "Send Messages", "Use Slash Commands", and "Embed Links" permissions
-   For moderation features, check "Timeout Members", "Ban Members", and "Manage Roles" permissions
-   Verify permissions in the specific channel you're using

**Test in Different Contexts:**

-   Try commands in DMs to isolate server-specific issues
-   Test in different channels if server commands aren't working
-   Use `/help` to verify the bot is responsive

**Slash Command Issues:**

-   Refresh Discord (Ctrl+R) to update slash command cache
-   Check if slash commands are enabled in your server settings
-   Try using commands without autocomplete

### AI responses seem limited or don't remember previous conversations?

**Context Logging Settings:**

-   Check your privacy settings with `/preferences view`
-   Enable context logging with `/preferences update context_logging:true` for better AI responses
-   Server admins may have disabled context logging - check with `/guildsettings view`

**View Your AI Context:**

-   Use `/context` to see what conversation history the AI has access to
-   If context is empty, previous conversations may have been cleared or logging was disabled
