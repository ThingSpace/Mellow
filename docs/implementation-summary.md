## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Guild Context Command Implementation

**File:** `src/commands/slash/guild/guildcontext.js`

**Features:**

-   New `/guildcontext` command for server administrators
-   Shows guild-level conversation context statistics (counts only, not content)

-   Rich embed display with organized metrics:
    -   Message Context: total messages, user messages, AI responses, channels
    -   Activity Breakdown: 24h, 7 days, context types
    -   Privacy Settings: context logging status, opt-out info, data retention
-   Privacy-first approach - only shows counts, never content
-   Handles disabled context logging gracefully

**Privacy Features:**

-   Only displays message counts, never actual content
-   Respects both server-wide and individual user privacy settings
-   Shows clear notification if guild context logging is disabled
-   Transparent about what data is tracked and how it's used

    -   💝 Mental Health Support (check-ins, coping tools, ghost letters, gratitude)
    -   📈 Recent Activity (30-day breakdown with trends)
    -   🛡️ Safety & Moderation (reports, crisis interventions, privacy compliance)
-   Number formatting with `.toLocaleString()` for better readability
-   Error handling with graceful fallback
-   Better description and categorization

**New Metrics:**

-   Crisis event tracking
-   Gratitude entries

-   Comprehensive system health metrics:
    -   ⚡ System Performance (status, uptime, memory, latency)
    -   🌐 Connection Status (servers, users, shards, commands)
    -   🤖 AI Service Status (performance metrics)
    -   🔒 Privacy & Safety (context logging, crisis detection, data protection)
-   Dynamic status emoji (🟢 Excellent, 🟡 Good, 🔴 Monitoring)
-   Formatted uptime display (days, hours, minutes)
-   Performance alerts for high-load situations
-   Robust error handling with fallback status display

**Status Indicators:**

-   Memory usage thresholds for performance assessment
