Late-night companion mode automatically activates based on your timezone (set in `/preferences`) and provides gentler, more calming responses during late hours (10 PM - 6 AM). You can check your current mode with `/timemode`.

Mellow uses advanced AI to automatically detect signs of distress in messages and provides appropriate resources and support. It can also alert server moderators in serious situations while respecting your privacy.

Mellow offers breathing exercises, grounding techniques, journal prompts, music suggestions, personalized coping plans, and crisis resources. Access them with `/coping`, `/toolbox`, `/plan`, and `/support`.

### How do mood check-ins work?

Use `/checkin` to log your current mood, intensity (1-5), and recent activities. View your trends with `/insights` and your overall mental health journey with `/profile`.
