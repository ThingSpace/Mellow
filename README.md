# Mellow — Your AI-Powered Mental Health Companion for Discord

**Mellow** is an AI-powered mental health companion that lives right inside Discord. It's not a therapist — but it _is_ a safe, supportive presence you can talk to when things feel heavy, confusing, or just too much.

## About Mellow

Mellow is designed to be a gentle, empathetic, and private support bot for anyone who needs a moment of stillness, a safe conversation, or a reminder that empathy matters — even online.

**Key Features:**

-   **Emotional Check-Ins:** Track your mood and reflect on how you're really doing.
-   **Ghost Letter Mode:** Vent privately with messages only you can see.
-   **Coping Tools & Prompts:** Access grounding techniques, breathing guides, and more.
-   **Crisis Routing:** Gently recommend professional help or alert moderators if someone is in distress.
-   **Late-Night Companion Mode:** Always available for calm, quiet support at any hour.

## Usage

Invite Mellow to your server or DM it directly. Use slash commands like `/checkin`, `/ghostletter`, or `/coping` to access its features.

## Important Note

Mellow is **not** a replacement for therapy or professional help. It's here for support, reflection, and companionship — not diagnosis or treatment.
